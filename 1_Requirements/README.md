# Working
 The Door Sensor serves as a security and warning system. It is available in two pieces on the market. One component attaches to the door frame, while the other attaches to the door parallel to the first component. When the door is shut, the two sections form a closed circuit. The magnet and switch separate when the door opens, breaking the circuit. When the circuit is broken, the sensor sends a signal to the central control panel, which activates the (light emitting diodes)LED.When switch is open,LED is blinking,When switch is close,LED will not blinking.
